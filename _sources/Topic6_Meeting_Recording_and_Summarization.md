# 6. Meeting Recording and Summarization

In fast-paced environments, meetings are critical for collaboration, but keeping track of what was said, who is responsible for what, and the next steps can be challenging. This topic focuses on how AI tools like [Otter.ai](http://Otter.ai) can transform meeting productivity by transcribing conversations, summarizing discussions, and extracting action items automatically. Whether you are hosting a team check-in, attending a client call, or reviewing a committee session, these tools help ensure that no important detail is missed and that everyone stays aligned, even those who could not attend.

## 6.1 Objective
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:
- Use AI tools to transcribe meetings in real time or from recordings.
- Automatically extract key points, decisions, and action items.
- Create and share summarized notes for team collaboration and follow-up.

## 6.2 Use Cases
- Real-time meeting transcription
- Action item extraction
- Sending meeting notes to absent attendees
- Finding timestamps within an audio file

## 6.3 Step-by-Step Guidelines

### Step 1: Upload The Audio File for Transcription

Use [Otter.ai](http://Otter.ai) (or simulate with ChatGPT) to:

- Upload the 'Apple2024Form.wav' audio file using the Import button at the top. <br>
	[Audio File](./data/Apple2024Form.wav)
- Let the tool generate:
    - A full transcript
    - A summary 
    - Key topics or action items  

### Step 2: Choose a Meeting Scenario

**Scenario 1: Sales Meeting Drama**

**Scenario 2: Voice Assistant Prototype**

**Scenario 3: Legal Deposition**

### Step 3: Analyze the Meeting Artifacts

Using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Claude](https://claude.ai), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) or your tool of choice upload your scenario from 'Step 2' and ask one of the following questions.

**Example Prompts:**

*Instructional Prompt 1*
```
Write an email update summarizing today’s meeting for someone who wasn’t there.
```
*Instructional Prompt 2*
```
Summarize the key outcomes of this meeting. Include:
- A concise 3-sentence summary
- A bullet-point list of the main topics discussed and decisions made
- Assigned responsibilities and action items
```
*Role-Based Prompt*
```
Act as a project manager responsible for documenting team meetings. Based on this meeting transcript:
1. Identify and list all key takeaways (limit to 5).
2. Specify who is responsible for each action item discussed.
3. Draft a professional email update for colleagues who were absent, summarizing what was covered and highlighting next steps.
```
*Chain-of-Thought Prompt*
```
Let’s analyze this meeting step by step:
1. Extract the main discussion topics.
2. Identify decisions made and their justifications.
3. List assigned responsibilities and deadlines.
4. Summarize the meeting in 3 sentences for documentation.
5. Draft a short follow-up email to share with absent participants.
```

### Step 4: Find Key Quotes from Transcripts

**Scenario:** 
Imagine you are a news reporter and you need to quote individuals efficiently and accurately, you remember some of what was said in the clip, but you are trying to answer these questions or fill in the incomplete memories. 

_Questions:_
> 1. What "syncs all your photos and data"?

> 2.  **Fill in the Blank:** "Each segment kind of operates with __ and market dynamics."

> 3. The 10k is less like "the shiny press releases" and more like what?

### Additional Information

Tip: Most tools like [Fireflies.ai](http://Fireflies.ai) and [Otter.ai](http://Otter.ai) integrate with Zoom, Google Meet, and MS Teams, allowing auto-distribution of summaries post-meeting.

## 6.4 Bonus Ideas (if time allows)
- Use tools to create follow-up reminders or sync to a task manager (e.g., Notion, Asana)
- Compare manual note-taking to AI-generated summaries
- Try live transcription in real-time (if tools are available)

## 6.5 Wrap-Up Reflection

- What scenario did you use?
- How accurate or useful was the transcription/summary?
- Where can you apply this in your team or class immediately?
