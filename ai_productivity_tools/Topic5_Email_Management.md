## 5.3 Use Cases

- Summarizing long email threads

## 5.4 Step-by-Step Guidelines

### Step 1: Define Your Email Context

Choose an email scenario that matches your day-to-day work:

- Academic (student inquiries, project updates, peer communication)
- Business (client follow-ups, internal coordination, reporting)
- Marketing/Sales (campaign feedback, customer service)
- Personal (job search, event coordination, inbox cleanup)

*No email to work with?* Use a sample thread provided or imagine a common scenario from your role.

### Step 2: Summarize an Email Thread

Use MailMaestro AI Assistant Interface to:
- Instantly summarize the selected email topic or thread in a few sentences.
- Use the “Reply” feature. On “Instruct the AI to write your email box”, try writing some simple instructions and watch the performance of the tool.

**Example Prompts**

*Instructional Prompts*
```
Accept this invitation but make it funny
```
```
Ask for more details in a polite way
```
```
Raise concerns about this approach without being rude
```

### Step 3: Draft a Personalized Email Response

Ask the AI to help draft a polite, professional, or persuasive reply using the "Instruct the AI to write your email" box under "Reply". Include:
- Your intended tone (e.g., casual, formal, assertive)
- The goal of the response (e.g., approve, schedule, clarify, escalate)

**Example Prompts**

*Instructional Prompt*
```
Write a professional reply confirming the meeting and requesting an agenda.
```
```
Draft a polite follow-up email after no response to a proposal.
```
```
Accept this invitation but make it funny
```
```
Respond to this customer complaint with empathy and a solution.
```

## 5.5 Bonus Ideas**
- Ask AI to rewrite emails in a different tone (e.g., more concise, more diplomatic)  
- Translate your email into another language for global communication  
- Create email templates for recurring tasks (meeting confirmations, feedback requests, etc.)
