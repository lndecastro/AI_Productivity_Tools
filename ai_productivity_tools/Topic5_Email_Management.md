# 5. Email Management (20 minutes)

Email remains one of the most time-consuming aspects of professional communication, often filled with repetitive tasks, long threads, and a constant demand for timely responses. In this topic, participants will explore how AI-powered tools can help streamline email workflows, summarizing conversations, drafting replies, and prioritizing messages with minimal effort. Whether you are managing a busy inbox, communicating with clients, or organizing internal updates, AI can serve as a powerful assistant to reduce friction and boost productivity.

## 5.1 Objective

By the end of this topic, participants will:

- Use AI tools to summarize, respond to, and organize emails efficiently.
- Learn how to automate repetitive email tasks while maintaining personalization and tone.
- Apply these strategies in their own email context (academic, business, client-facing, etc.).

## 5.2 Tools

- **Gmail Smart Compose**
- **Outlook Copilot**

## 5.3 Use Cases

- Summarizing long email threads  
- Drafting personalized responses  
- Auto-categorizing and prioritizing emails  

## 5.4 Step-by-Step Guidelines

### Step 1: Define Your Email Context (2 minutes)

Choose an email scenario that matches your day-to-day work:

- Academic (student inquiries, project updates, peer communication)
- Business (client follow-ups, internal coordination, reporting)
- Marketing/Sales (campaign feedback, customer service)
- Personal (job search, event coordination, inbox cleanup)

*No email to work with?* Use a sample thread provided or imagine a common scenario from your role.

### Step 2: Summarize an Email Thread (4–5 minutes)

Use Outlook Copilot or Gmail’s Smart Summary features (or simulate with ChatGPT) to:
- Paste or summarize a long email conversation.
- Ask the AI to extract key points, next steps, or action items.

*Example Prompts:*
```text
Summarize this email chain into a few bullet points for a quick update.
```
```text
What decisions were made in this email thread?
```
```text
List the main concerns raised and the sender's tone.
```

### Step 3: Draft a Personalized Email Response (5–7 minutes)

Ask the AI to help draft a polite, professional, or persuasive reply. Include:
- Your intended tone (e.g., casual, formal, assertive)
- The goal of the response (e.g., approve, schedule, clarify, escalate)

*Example Prompts:*
```text
Write a professional reply confirming the meeting and requesting an agenda.
```
```text
Draft a polite follow-up email after no response to a proposal.
```
```text
Respond to this customer complaint with empathy and a solution.
```

### Step 4: Auto-Organize and Prioritize (3–5 minutes)

Explore or simulate how tools like Outlook Copilot and Gmail Categories can:
- Filter by urgency (e.g., “important,” “follow up,” “not urgent”)
- Auto-categorize messages (promotions, updates, social, etc.)
- Flag or archive based on keywords, sender, or thread behavior

*Example Prompts:*
```text
Highlight emails that require a response today.
```
```text
Group emails from students requesting deadline extensions.
```
```text
Create rules to automatically sort team updates into a folder.
```

**Bonus Ideas (if time allows):**
- Ask AI to rewrite emails in a different tone (e.g., more concise, more diplomatic)  
- Translate your email into another language for global communication  
- Create email templates for recurring tasks (meeting confirmations, feedback requests, etc.)
