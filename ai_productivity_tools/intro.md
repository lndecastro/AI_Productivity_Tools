## 2. Structure and Approach

Each session is structured around a short introduction, hands-on activity, and a reflection period. You will be encouraged to:

- Experiment with AI prompts tailored to your professional context
- Compare outputs across different tools
- Share findings and discuss best practices
- Develop your own AI-enhanced productivity workflow

At the end of the workshop, participants will complete a final project applying AI tools to a task relevant to their field or organization.




No programming experience is required. The focus is on building your ability to extract business-oriented insights, visualize relationships, and tell impactful stories with data, both with and without AI. By the end of this course, you will be equipped to apply AI-augmented workflows to real-world data projects and contribute to a data-driven culture in any organization.
