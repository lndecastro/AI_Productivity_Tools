# 7. AI Assistants in Action: Google AI Studio + Stream

In this session, participants will explore the hands-on use of AI assistants in dynamic, real-world contexts using **Google AI Studio** with the **Stream function** enabled. The focus is on teaching AI to interact with **your environment** through a **background camera** or **screen capture**. This powerful setup brings AI into your personal or digital workspace, enhancing observation, navigation, and productivity.

## 7.1 Tools & Setup

- **Platform**: Google AI Studio
- **Key Feature**: Stream
- **Capabilities Used**:
  - Background Camera
  - Screen Capture
  - Real-Time AI Interaction

> *Ensure the Stream function is enabled and permissions for camera and screen sharing are granted.*

## 7.2 Use Case 1: Interacting with the Physical Environment

**Scenario**: The participant activates their **background camera** and points it toward their environment (e.g., desk, classroom, lab, objects).

*Instructional + Role-Based Interaction (Prompt)*
```
Observe my environment and describe what you see. Focus on identifying objects and their likely purpose or function. Then suggest one or two ideas for organizing or improving this workspace for productivity.
```

*Alternative Prompt (Educational Context):*
```
Act as a tutor. I'm pointing my camera at an object. Explain what you're seeing.
[SELECT THE OBJECT OR CONTEXT]
```

**What students learn**:
- How to direct the AI’s visual attention
- How to formulate prompts to extract meaningful insights from real-time observations

## 7.3 Use Case 2: Navigating the Digital Workspace

**Scenario**: The participant shares their **screen** (e.g., browser, application, workspace, spreadsheet), and the AI assistant provides support.

*Chain-of-Thought + Instructional Prompt*
```
Watch my screen as I navigate my email inbox. Help me:
1. Identify unread messages and group them by priority
2. Draft responses to the top three messages
3. Create a task list based on action items in the emails
```

*Instructional Prompt (Productivity/UX)*
```
I am going to open a website I am unfamiliar with. As I explore, please explain what each section seems to do, and guide me to locate the help center and pricing information.
```

**What students learn**:
- How to use AI to co-pilot navigation tasks
- Prompt strategies for incremental guidance (e.g., step-by-step help)

## 7.4 Wrap-Up and Reflection

- How does AI change your interaction with the physical or digital workspace?
- What new applications can you envision for Stream-enabled assistants in your work?
- What were the limits or surprises in the AI’s responses?

## Suggested Activities

- **Pair work**: One student guides the AI using Stream while the other evaluates the AI's accuracy and helpfulness
- **Prompt tuning challenge**: Refine a prompt to get clearer or more insightful observations
- **Use-case design**: Students brainstorm how Stream could be applied in their discipline (e.g., teaching, design, health, research)

> *Stream opens the door to contextual AI that sees what you see. The real skill is in shaping what it should do with what it sees.*
