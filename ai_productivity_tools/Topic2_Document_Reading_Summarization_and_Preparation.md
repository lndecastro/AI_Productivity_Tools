## 2.4 Step-by-Step Guidelines

### Step 1: Choose Your Context 

Pick a document type or goal relevant to your profession, role, or interest:

- Academic (research article, thesis chapter, literature review)
- Business (proposal, SOP, performance report)
- Legal (case summary, policy draft)
- Marketing (campaign outline, blog post, newsletter)
- Healthcare (patient report, research brief)
- Personal (job application, resume, learning material)

*Don’t have your own document?* Use a pre-provided sample from the workshop folder or search a public domain text using Perplexity or ChatGPT.

### Step 2: Load and Summarize 

Use a tool like ChatGPT/Gemini/Copilot/etc., Claude, NotebookLM, or Perplexity to:

- Upload or paste your document
- Ask the AI to generate:
  - A summary (short or detailed)
  - A bullet list of main points
  - Key questions or FAQs
  - A timeline (for reports or historical data)
  - A podcast with the content

**Example Prompts:**

**Example Prompts:**

We're a mid-sized furniture company called GreenHome launching sustainable bamboo furniture (chairs, tables, and shelves) that uses no plastic and comes with a 10-year warranty.
Our target audience is environmentally conscious homeowners ages 30-45 who value quality and sustainability.
The post should highlight our sustainability commitment, mention our upcoming 15% launch discount valid for the next two weeks, and include a call-to-action to visit our website.
Please keep the tone warm but professional, and limit the post to 150 words maximum for optimal social media engagement.
```

*Job Application Letter - Role-Based + Instructional Prompt*
```
You are a seasoned career advisor who helps professionals craft persuasive cover letters.
Please help me draft a compelling cover letter for a Marketing Manager position at TechInnovate, a software company specializing in AI solutions for healthcare.
I have 6 years of experience in digital marketing, with the last 3 years focused on the tech sector at SmartSolutions Inc. where I increased lead generation by 40% and managed a team of 4 content creators.
My relevant skills include campaign management, SEO optimization, team leadership, and data analytics.
I have a Bachelor's in Marketing and an MBA with a digital marketing concentration. The job posting emphasizes experience with B2B marketing strategies and cross-functional collaboration.
I'm particularly drawn to this role because of TechInnovate's mission to make healthcare more accessible through technology, which aligns with my personal values.
The letter should be professional but showcase my enthusiasm for their company culture of innovation.
```

*Customer Survey - Chain-of-Thought Prompt*
```
I need to create a customer satisfaction survey for my online bookstore, PageTurner, which sells both physical and e-books.

Let’s approach this step by step:

1. First, list the key goals of this survey. Focus on what insights we need to gain to improve the customer experience.

2. Next, for each goal, suggest the best types of questions to ask (e.g., multiple choice, rating scale, open-ended), and briefly explain why.

3. Then, draft the actual survey questions. Include a short introduction that explains the purpose and time commitment (~5 minutes), and design the survey to take no longer than that. Cover:
   - Customer demographics
   - Purchasing habits
   - Website usability
   - Delivery satisfaction
   - Areas for improvement

4. Include a friendly thank-you message at the end and offer a 10% discount code as a completion incentive.

Keep the tone friendly and reflective of PageTurner’s approachable, book-loving brand.
