### Step 2: Load and Summarize 

Use a tool like ChatGPT, Claude, NotebookLM, or Perplexity to:

- Upload or paste your document
- Ask the AI to generate:
  - A summary (short or detailed)
  - A bullet list of main points
  - Key questions or FAQs
  - A timeline (for reports or historical data)
  - A podcast with the content

**Example Prompts:**

```
Summarize this research article in plain language and highlight the key findings.
```
```
Extract 5 key action items from this document.
```
```
Turn this report into an executive summary.
```

### Step 3: Draft or Prepare a New Document 

Pick a goal from below and ask the AI to help you create a draft:

- Proposal
- Social media post
- Resume/CV
- Job application letter
- Slide presentation outline
- Customer survey
- Training document or SOP

**Example Prompts:**

*Social Media Post*
```
I need to create an engaging social media post for my company's new eco-friendly product line.
We're a mid-sized furniture company called GreenHome launching sustainable bamboo furniture (chairs, tables, and shelves) that uses no plastic and comes with a 10-year warranty.
Our target audience is environmentally conscious homeowners ages 30-45 who value quality and sustainability.
The post should highlight our sustainability commitment, mention our upcoming 15% launch discount valid for the next two weeks, and include a call-to-action to visit our website.
Please keep the tone warm but professional, and limit the post to 150 words maximum for optimal social media engagement.
```
*Job Application Letter*
```
Please help me draft a compelling cover letter for a Marketing Manager position at TechInnovate, a software company specializing in AI solutions for healthcare.
I have 6 years of experience in digital marketing, with the last 3 years focused on the tech sector at SmartSolutions Inc. where I increased lead generation by 40% and managed a team of 4 content creators.
My relevant skills include campaign management, SEO optimization, team leadership, and data analytics.
I have a Bachelor's in Marketing and an MBA with a digital marketing concentration. The job posting emphasizes experience with B2B marketing strategies and cross-functional collaboration.
I'm particularly drawn to this role because of TechInnovate's mission to make healthcare more accessible through technology, which aligns with my personal values.
The letter should be professional but showcase my enthusiasm for their company culture of innovation.
```
*Customer Survey*
```
I need to create a customer satisfaction survey for my online bookstore, PageTurner, which sells both physical and e-books. We've been operating for 3 years and want to improve our customer experience.
The survey should help us understand: customer demographics, purchasing habits, website usability, delivery satisfaction, and areas for improvement.
Please include a mix of multiple-choice questions, rating scales (1-5), and 2-3 open-ended questions. The survey should take no more than 5 minutes to complete.
Start with a brief introduction explaining the purpose and approximate time commitment, and end with a thank you message and offer of a 10% discount code for their next purchase as an incentive for completion.
Use a friendly, approachable tone that reflects our brand personality.
```

### Step 4: Evaluate and Refine 

Use AI to:

- Refine tone and formatting
- Translate content (if needed)
- Check for clarity, professionalism, and alignment with goals

**Example Prompts:**

```
Make this more concise and formal.
```
```
Rephrase this for a general audience.
```
```
Convert this into bullet points suitable for a slide.
```

**Bonus Ideas (if time allows):**

- Generate a podcast script from your source (use NotebookLM)
- Ask for citations or source links (use Perplexity or ChatGPT with web access)
- Create an interactive FAQ for training
