# 6. Meeting Recording and Summarization (20 minutes)

In fast-paced environments, meetings are critical for collaboration, but keeping track of what was said, who’s responsible for what, and the next steps can be challenging. This topic focuses on how AI tools like Otter.ai and Fireflies.ai can transform meeting productivity by transcribing conversations, summarizing discussions, and extracting action items automatically. Whether you are hosting a team check-in, attending a client call, or reviewing a committee session, these tools help ensure that no important detail is missed and that everyone stays aligned, even those who could not attend.

## 6.1 Objective

By the end of this session, participants will:

- Use AI tools to transcribe meetings in real time or from recordings.
- Automatically extract key points, decisions, and action items.
- Create and share summarized notes for team collaboration and follow-up.

## 6.2 Tools

- **Otter.ai**
- **Fireflies.ai**

## 6.3 Use Cases

- Real-time meeting transcription  
- Action item extraction  
- Sending meeting notes to absent attendees  

## 6.4 Step-by-Step Guidelines

### Step 1: Choose a Meeting Scenario (2 minutes)

Think of a meeting you frequently participate in or manage:
- Academic (thesis defense, committee meetings, class lectures)
- Business (weekly team check-in, client call, sales pitch)
- Healthcare/Admin (case reviews, operational planning)
- Personal/Volunteer (event planning, community coordination)

*No real meeting?* Use a pre-provided transcript or simulate a short meeting scenario from your field.

### Step 2: Upload or Simulate a Meeting Transcript (5–6 minutes)

Use Otter.ai or Fireflies.ai (or simulate with ChatGPT) to:
- Upload an audio file or paste a short meeting script or summary.
- Let the tool generate:
  - A full transcript  
  - A summary  
  - Key topics or action items  

*Example Prompts (for simulation with ChatGPT):*
```text
Here’s a transcript. What are the 5 key takeaways?
```
```text
Extract action items and who they are assigned to.
```
```text
Summarize this meeting in 3 sentences.
```

### Step 3: Identify and Share Action Items (4–5 minutes)

Use built-in AI tools or prompts to highlight:
- Action items with deadlines  
- Stakeholder assignments  
- Open questions or unresolved issues  

*Example Prompts:*
```text
List all action items discussed in this meeting.
```
```text
Who is responsible for what based on this discussion?
```
```text
Create a task list with due dates from this meeting transcript.
```

### Step 4: Prepare Notes for Absent Attendees (4–5 minutes)

Ask the AI to create a clean, shareable meeting summary suitable for teammates or stakeholders who missed the meeting.

*Example Prompts:*
```text
Write an email update summarizing today’s meeting for someone who wasn’t there.
```
```text
Generate a bullet-point list of what was discussed and decided.
```
```text
Draft a short meeting recap with links to resources and next steps.
```

Tip: Most tools like Fireflies.ai and Otter.ai integrate with Zoom, Google Meet, and MS Teams, allowing auto-distribution of summaries post-meeting.

**Bonus Ideas (if time allows):**
- Use tools to create follow-up reminders or sync to a task manager (e.g., Notion, Asana)  
- Compare manual note-taking to AI-generated summaries  
- Try live transcription in real-time (if tools are available)  

## 6.5 Wrap-Up Reflection (2 minutes)

- What meeting context did you use?  
- How accurate or useful was the transcription/summary?  
- Where can you apply this in your team or class immediately?
