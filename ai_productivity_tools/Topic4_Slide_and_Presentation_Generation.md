# 4. Slide and Presentation Generation

Creating clear, compelling presentations is a vital skill in both academic and professional settings, but building slides from scratch can be time-consuming and creatively demanding. This topic explores how AI tools can automate the process of turning complex ideas, written documents, or outlines into structured, visually engaging slide decks. Participants will learn how to generate, refine, and enhance presentations using tools like ChatGPT, Claude.ai, and Gamma.app, saving time while improving communication impact and design quality.

## 4.1 Objective

By the end of this session, participants will:

- Use AI tools to automatically generate slides from existing text or documents.
- Summarize complex ideas into clear, visual presentations.
- Enhance slide aesthetics and structure using AI-driven design tools.

## 4.2 Tools

- Gamma.app
- General-Purpose GenAI Tools

## 4.3 Use Cases

- Auto-generating slide decks from documents  
- Creating visual summaries of complex ideas  
- Design enhancement via AI

## 4.4 Gamma.app

The presentation outline below was created for the Design Thinking Process using a circular/looping structure. In Gamma.app select *Create new AI* and try both scenarios below:

### Gamma.app: Paste in text
```
- Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: The Design Thinking Process
Subtitle: A Human-Centered Approach to Innovation Presented by: [Your Name or Institution]
- Slide 2: Overview
What is Design Thinking? Design Thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, and redefine problems to identify alternative strategies and solutions.
- Slide 3: The Four Core Stages
Design Thinking Loop Use a circular diagram with these four stages:
- Empathize
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
Each stage feeds into the next, but the process is flexible and iterative.
- Slide 4: Empathize
Goal: Understand the user’s needs and experiences. Methods: Interviews, observations, immersion. Why it matters: Builds a foundation of genuine insight.
- Slide 5: Define
Goal: Clearly articulate the problem to solve. Methods: Point-of-view statements, problem framing. Why it matters: Focuses the team on the right challenge.
- Slide 6: Ideate
Goal: Generate a wide range of creative solutions. Methods: Brainstorming, mind mapping, sketching. Why it matters: Encourages innovation and exploration.
- Slide 7: Prototype
Goal: Build quick, low-fidelity versions of ideas. Methods: Paper models, digital mockups, role-playing. Why it matters: Allows fast feedback and iteration.
- Slide 8: Iteration is Key
Design Thinking is not linear. You may loop back to earlier stages as you learn more. This flexibility is what makes it powerful.
- Slide 9: Final Thoughts
Design Thinking empowers teams to solve complex problems with empathy, creativity, and experimentation.
```

### Gamma.app: Generate
*Role-Based Prompt*
```
You are an expert instructional designer creating presentations for a graduate-level design thinking course. 
Your task is to create a minimal, professional, and academic-friendly presentation titled “The Design Thinking Process.”
The audience consists of university students in business and engineering programs.
```

## 4.5 Step-by-Step Guidelines Using General-Purpose GenAI Tools

### Step 1: Define Your Presentation Goal

Pick a context or scenario relevant to your role:
- Academic (lecture slide, research summary, course module)
- Business (pitch deck, team update, training material)
- Marketing (product/service promo, social media strategy)
- Educational (tutorial, process explanation, explainer deck)
- Personal (event presentation, portfolio, resume slides)

### Step 2: Generate a Slide Outline

Use any GenAI tool to:
- Input a topic, summary, or paste a document.
- Ask for a slide-by-slide outline with titles and lists.

**Example Prompts:**

*Instructional Prompt*
```
Create a 7-slide outline for a presentation titled "Introduction to Generative AI for Business Executives."
The audience consists of non-technical managers. Include:
1. Title slide
2. What is Generative AI?
3. How it works (briefly)
4. Use cases in business
5. Risks and limitations
6. Strategic opportunities
7. Final takeaway or call-to-action
Keep the tone confident, concise, and suitable for a boardroom presentation.
```

*Role-Based Prompt*
```
You are a strategy consultant preparing an investor update deck for a cybersecurity tech startup.
Create a 10-slide outline that includes:
- Vision and mission
- Market opportunity
- Product overview
- Business model
- Traction and KPIs
- Competitive landscape
- Go-to-market strategy
- Financials
- Team
- Ask
Use persuasive, VC-friendly language and keep slides data-focused.
```

*Chain-of-Thought Prompt*
```
Let’s build this slide deck step-by-step:
1. Identify the audience and goal: A high school science class learning about photosynthesis.
2. Determine 5–6 key concepts they need to understand.
3. Organize those concepts into a logical learning progression.
4. Generate a slide outline using those concepts.
5. Suggest images or visual aids for each slide.
Now execute this step-by-step and return a slide outline and image suggestions.
```

### Step 3: Auto-Create a Slide Deck

Use any GenAI tool to:
- Copy the outline into the tool and auto-generate slides.
- Let the AI suggest visual layouts, icons, charts, and transitions.
- Adjust colors, branding, or add visuals as needed.

Tip: Most tools allow theme customization, try selecting a clean, modern theme for clarity.

**Example Prompts**

*Instructional Prompt*
```
Turn this outline into a full slide deck. Each slide should have:
- A concise title
- 2–4 bullet points
- A brief speaker note (1–2 sentences)
- Suggested visuals or diagrams
Keep the design minimal and the tone confident and professional.
[PASTE SLIDE OUTLINE]
```

*Prompt Chain (Outline → Slide Content → Speaker Notes)*
```
1. Start by creating a slide outline based on this input topic: "Digital Transformation in Higher Education."
2. Expand the outline into bullet-point content for each slide.
3. Add speaker notes that provide extra explanation or stories for each slide.
```

### Step 4: Polish the Design and Add Visuals

- Refine the tone and design (e.g., formal vs. casual, visual-heavy vs. text-light)
- Add images using built-in AI image search or tools like ChatGPT or Copilot
- Ask AI to suggest better headlines, animations, or illustrative graphics

**Example Prompts:**

*Role-Based Prompt*
```
You are a design advisor for slides. Improve this slide deck's structure and suggest layout or formatting improvements. The goal is clarity, accessibility, and engagement.
[PASTE SLIDE CONTENT]
```

*Instructional Prompt*
```
Suggest improvements to the structure and tone of this deck for an academic audience.
[PASTE OUTLINE OR SLIDE LIST]
```

## 4.6 Bonus Ideas (if time allows)
- Use AI to generate a speaker script or notes for each slide  
- Ask for a handout version of the slides  
- Export to PDF or link to a live presentation  

*Business Pitch Prompt (Few-Shot + Role-Based)*
```
Act as a startup coach. Using the structure from this pitch deck outline, generate a slide-by-slide pitch for a new edtech company targeting adult learners.
Include persuasive messaging, market data, and a closing ask slide.
```

*Prompt Chain (Text → Outline → Deck → Summary Handout)*
```
1. Read the provided paper.
2. Create a slide outline based on the main sections.
3. Expand each section into a slide with bullet points.
4. Generate a handout summarizing the deck in 1 page.
