## 6.4 Step-by-Step Guidelines

### Step 1: Upload The Audio File for Transcription (1-2 minutes)

Use [Otter.ai](http://Otter.ai) (or simulate with ChatGPT) to:

- Upload the `Apple 2024 Form 10-K Highlights.wav` audio file.
	![[Apple 2024 Form 10-K Highlights 1.wav]]
- Let the tool generate:
    - A full transcript
    - A summary 
    - Key topics or action items

### Step 3: Analyze the Meeting Artifacts (4–5 minutes)

Using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Claude](https://claude.ai), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) or your tool of choice upload your scenario from `Step 2` and ask one of the following questions.

_Example Prompts:_
```
What are the 5 key takeaways from this meeting?
```

```
Summarize this meeting in 3 sentences.
```

```
Who is responsible for what based on this discussion?
```

```
Write an email update summarizing today’s meeting for someone who wasn’t there.
```

```
Generate a bullet-point list of what was discussed and decided.
```

### Step 4: Find Key Quotes from Transcripts (4–5 minutes)

**Scenario:** 
Imagine you are a news reporter and you need to quote individuals efficiently and accurately, you remember some of what was said in the clip, but you are trying to answer these questions or fill in the incomplete memories. 

_Questions:_
> 1. What "syncs all your photos and data"?

> 2.  **Fill in the Blank:** "Each segment kind of operates with __ and market dynamics."

> 3. The 10k is less like "the shiny press releases" and more like what?
